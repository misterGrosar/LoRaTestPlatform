This are android applications for logging GPS position (LogGPSPosition) app and 
for logging indoor "position" (TimeLog).

- App for logging GPS position logs every secong GPS position of device,
once you connect to broker and click on "Start" button.

- App for logging indoor position works like this:
In reality it only logs time when user presses "Log time now" button. 
For example: user pre determinates route through building where moving node 
will move and orientation points on it before the measurements begin. 
When moving node reaches the orientation point, while moving on predetermined route,
user logs time. By knowing the orientation points and time when node has been 
on this points, one can draw map of signal coverage in the building.
